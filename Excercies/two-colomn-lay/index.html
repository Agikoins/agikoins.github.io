                    <p>
                        A chimerical color is an imaginary color that 
                        can 
                        be seen temporarily by looking steadily at a 
                        strong 
                        color until some of the cone cells become 
                        atigued, 
                        temporarily changing their color sensitivities,
                         and 
                        then looking at a markedly different color. 
                        The direct trichromatic description of vision 
                        cannot explain these colors, which can involve 
                        saturation signals outside the physical gamut 
                        imposed by the trichromatic model. Opponent process 
                        color theories, which treat intensity and chroma as 
                        separate visual signals, provide a biophysical 
                        explanation of these chimerical colors.[4] For 
                        example, staring at a saturated primary-color 
                        field and then looking at a white object results 
                        in an opposing shift in hue, causing an afterimage 
                        of the complementary color. Exploration of the color 
                        space outside the range of "real colors" by this means 
                        is major corroborating evidence for the opponent-process 
                        theory of color vision. Chimerical colors can be seen 
                        while seeing with one eye or with both eyes, and are 
                        not observed to reproduce simultaneously qualities of 
                        opposing colors (e.g. "yellowish blue").[4] Chimerical 
                        colors include:

                    <h3> Stygian Colors </h3>

                    <p>
                        These are simultaneously dark and impossibly 
                        saturated. For example, to see "stygian blue": 
                        staring at bright yellow causes a dark blue 
                        afterimage, then on looking at black, the blue is
                        seen as blue against the black, also as dark as 
                        the black. The color is not possible to achieve 
                        through normal vision, because the lack of i
                        ncident light (in the black) prevents saturation 
                        of the blue/yellow chromatic signal (the blue 
                        appearance).
                    </p>

                    <h3> Self-luminous Colors </h3>

                    <p>
                        These mimic the effect of glowing material, even 
                        when viewed on a medium such as paper, which can 
                        only reflect and not emit its own light. For 
                        example, to see "self-luminous red": staring at 
                        green causes a red afterimage, then on looking at 
                        white, the red is seen against the white and may 
                        seem to be brighter than the white.
                    </p>

                    <h3> Hyperbolic Colors </h3>

                    <p>
                        These are impossibly highly saturated. For example,
                        to see "hyperbolic orange": staring at bright cyan 
                        causes an orange afterimage, then on looking at 
                        orange, the resulting orange afterimage seen 
                        against the orange background may cause an orange 
                        color purer than the purest orange color that can 
                        be made by any normally-seen light.

                                According to the opponent-process theory, under 
                                normal circumstances, there is no hue that 
                                could be described as a mixture of opponent 
                                hues; that is, as a hue looking "redgreen" or 
                                "yellowblue".

                            <p>
                                In 1983, Hewitt D. Crane and Thomas P. 
                                Piantanida performed tests using an eye-tracker 
                                device that had a field of a vertical red stripe 
                                adjacent to a vertical green stripe, or several 
                                narrow alternating red and green stripes (or in 
                                some cases, yellow and blue instead). The device 
                                could track involuntary movements of one eye 
                                (there was a patch over the other eye) and adjust 
                                mirrors so the image would follow the eye and 
                                the boundaries of the stripes were always on the 
                                same places on the eye's retina; the field 
                                outside the stripes was blanked with occluders. 
                                Under such conditions, the edges between the 
                                stripes seemed to disappear (perhaps due to 
                                edge-detecting neurons becoming fatigued) and 
                                the colors flowed into each other in the brain's 
                                visual cortex, overriding the opponency mechanisms 
                                and producing not the color expected from mixing 
                                paints or from mixing lights on a screen, but new 
                                colors entirely, which are not in the CIE 1931 
                                color space, either in its real part or in its 
                                imaginary parts. For red-and-green, some saw an 
                                even field of the new color; some saw a regular 
                                pattern of just-visible green dots and red dots; 
                                some saw islands of one color on a background of 
                                the other color. Some of the volunteers for the 
                                experiment reported that afterward, they could 
                                still imagine the new colors for a period of 
                                time.[5]

                            Some observers indicated that although they were 
                            aware that what they were viewing was a color 
                            (that is, the field was not achromatic), they 
                            were unable to name or describe the color. One 
                            of these observers was an artist with large 
                            color vocabulary. Other observers of the novel 
                            hues described the first stimulus as a reddish-
                            green.[6]
